        <p>Powfu (born Isaiah Faber on March 31, 1999) is a Canadian artist known for blending genres like lo-fi hip-hop, emo rap, and indie music. He first gained widespread attention in 2020 with his viral hit "death bed (coffee for your head)," which has become a standout track in the lo-fi and emo rap scenes.

            His sound is characterized by chilled, mellow beats, often accompanied by introspective, emotional lyrics. Powfu’s music tends to focus on themes like mental health, love, loss, and self-reflection, all while maintaining a laid-back, low-fi production style. His distinctive voice, often mixed with acoustic guitar or soft piano, gives his tracks an intimate, raw feel.
            
            After "death bed" went viral on platforms like TikTok, Powfu released his debut project poems of the past in 2020. The song and the album helped him build a strong following, particularly among younger audiences, and marked his entry into the mainstream music scene.
            
            Despite his rise to fame through a viral track, Powfu’s music speaks to much deeper emotions and resonates with listeners who connect with his introspective, often melancholic lyrics.
            
            He continues to release music, expanding on his sound and maintaining his indie spirit. If you're into chill, introspective vibes, Powfu's music might be right up your alley!</p>
